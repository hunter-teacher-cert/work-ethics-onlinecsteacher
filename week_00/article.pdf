The Slander Industry

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/24/technology/online-slander-websites.html

This article highlights how uncontrolled the internet is especially with respect to information posted about actual people. The article profiles various professional slanderers, i.e. people who create posts on different websites (that are then linked to other websites to make them appear first in Google search engines) that destroy the reputations of other people.

This topic of internet slander directly relates to a unit I taught my middle school students on cyberbullying. According to this article, the posts created are fraudulent, but there is no mechanism to check their veracity. There is also no mechanism to remove the posts entirely. Various websites offer post removal services in the thousands of dollars but there is no guarantee that these posts won't resurface shortly after.

The term I use when teaching about Internet safety is "digital footprint". Just as we leave footprints when walking, our online "tracks" are equally visible to others. A picture I post on Facebook could be seen by my friends and also my future employer. A thread I create on Twitter is seen by my followers and by strangers across the world. It is especially important for younger students who are new to social media and digital sharing that anything they post online can be accessed by other people including people they may have never met.
